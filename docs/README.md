# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

This README serves as the central entry point for all project management processes and practices at OctoAcme. Here you’ll find a high-level summary of how projects are managed, delivered, and improved at OctoAcme, along with quick links to every related process document for easy navigation and reference.

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme adopts a structured, iterative approach designed to drive transparency, accountability, and predictable delivery across cross-functional teams. Projects are organized into five stages: initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective, with clear milestones and deliverables defined at every step. Initiatives begin with stakeholder alignment and a lightweight plan, and continue through to regular retrospectives focused on capturing lessons and driving continuous improvement.

Key roles are distinctly defined. The Project Manager (PM) is accountable for coordinating delivery and risk management, the Product Manager (PdM) owns product direction and backlog, while Developers and QA are responsible for implementation and quality assurance. Stakeholders provide input and approve key artifacts, ensuring alignment from inception to delivery. Role clarity and artifact standards (e.g., project one-pager, risk register, backlog) help reduce confusion and foster efficient, repeatable execution.

Communication is central to OctoAcme’s processes: daily stand-ups, weekly delivery syncs, and monthly stakeholder updates ensure that progress, risks, and successes are actively surfaced. Documentation standards (like project boards and regular status templates) keep everyone on the same page and make onboarding easier for new team members. Clear escalation paths and templates for status and incident communication provide confidence in fast and effective problem resolution.

Quality assurance is seamlessly woven throughout the lifecycle. Automated testing, manual QA, security scanning, and structured release/rollback plans are integral to every deliverable. Each release is carefully prepared, tested, and communicated. The end of every cycle features a retrospective meeting to capture what went well and what can be improved—closing the learning loop and helping to make OctoAcme’s project management a continually strengthening asset for the team.
